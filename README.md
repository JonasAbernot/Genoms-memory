Genoms-memory
=============

Using simulated evolution of DNA sequences, the project aims at enligthing how long the DNA molecule keeps a print its past.

I/Inversions
The given script allow comparison between the number of inversions processed to reach the last state of the genome and the minimum number of inversions necessary to come back to initial state along time.
